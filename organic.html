        <h1>ORGANIC FARMING</h1>
        <h2>Types of organic farming</h2>
        <h3>1.Pure Organic Farming<br>
            2.Integrated Organic Farming
        </h3>
        <h2>1.Pure Organic Farming</h2>
        <h4>An integral part of methods for organic farming method involves the use of organic inputs like green manures and cow dung. Green manures and cultivated cover crops play a crucial role in improving soil fertility, while cow dung serves as a valuable organic agriculture, contributing to soil enrichment and fostering a sustainable approach to crop cultivation. In essence, organic farming in India embodies a harmonious and environmentally conscious approach to agriculture, promoting the well-being of both the land and its inhabitants.</h4>
        <h4>#Elimination of Synthetic Inputs: Organic farming practices aim to exclude the use of synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers, relying instead on natural alternatives for pest control and soil fertility.<br>
          #Promotion of Natural Pest Control: The main focus of organic agriculture is that instead of relying on chemical pesticides, organic farming employs methods like companion planting and biological pest control to manage pests and diseases in an eco-friendly manner.<br>
          #Enhancement of Soil Health: The objective of organic agriculture is to improve soil fertility and structure through the use of organic inputs such as compost, green manures, and animal manure, fostering long-term productivity.<br>
          #Sustainable Agriculture Practices: The main organic farming process includes avoiding synthetic inputs and emphasizing organic alternatives; organic agriculture contributes to sustainable agricultural practices that are environmentally friendly.<br>
          #Biodiversity Promotion: Organic farming encourages the cultivation of diverse crops and discourages monoculture, fostering biodiversity to maintain natural balance and reduce the risk of pests and diseases.<br>
          #Eco-Friendly Crop Rotation: Organic farmers employ crop rotation strategies in organic agriculture to maintain soil health, prevent nutrient depletion, and reduce the risk of pests and diseases associated with continuous monoculture. This is one of the most important process of organic farming.<br>
          #Respect for Ecological Balance: The most important objective of organic agriculture is to create a harmonious balance between agriculture and nature, prioritizing practices that support the health of the entire ecosystem.<br>

          <h2>History of AsmitA’s Organic Farming in India</h2>
          <h4>In 1990, Mr. Muzaffar Hussain sowed the seeds of AsmitA Organic Farms in the serene landscapes of Ramtek, Nagpur, Maharashtra. His journey began with a singular vision – to revolutionize Indian agriculture. Moving beyond conventional farming practices, Mr. Hussain explored the coastal realms of Dhanau in 2007, fostering a deep understanding of the interconnectedness between nature and organic agriculture.

            With time comes experience, and in 2017, AsmitA Organic Farms underwent a transformative shift under Mr Hussain’s discerning eye. Recognizing the urgent need for sustainable practices, he introduced 100% organic natural farming and organic agriculture techniques. This commitment to chemical-free cultivation and the methodology of organic farming evolved into a groundbreaking initiative in 2021, with the establishment of the ‘organic spice garden’ – the first of its kind in Vidharbha, Maharashtra. Today, in 2023, AsmitA Organic Farms stands as a beacon of sustainable and organic agriculture following 100% organic farm practices, boasting over 72+ organic products. Strict adherence to organic guidelines has become the bedrock of our operations, ensuring that every product reflects the essence of genuine, chemical-free nourishment. The legacy of AsmitA Organic Farms continues to thrive, offering a promise of real food that is not a rarity, a fair share for farmers, and a planet breathing in an atmosphere of respect, love, and care.
            
            <h2>2.Integrated Organic Farming</h2>
            <h4> On the other hand, integrated organic farming takes a comprehensive approach by merging pest management and nutrient management strategies. The goal of integrated organic grown farming methods is to meet ecological requirements while simultaneously addressing economic demands. These green farming practices recognize the interconnectedness of various farming aspects, integrating them into a cohesive system. Farmers practising integrated organic farming carefully balance the use of organic fertilizers and bio-pesticides with other ecological practices to create a harmonious and sustainable farming ecosystem.</h4>
            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <h4>An integrated organic farming system (IOFS) model comprising agricultural and horticultural crops, rainwater harvesting units, livestock components, and provisions for nutrient recycling was developed and disseminated in the adopted organic villages Mynsain, Pynthor, and Umden Umbathiang in the Ri-Bhoi District, Meghalaya, India, to improve the income and livelihood of farmers. Harvested rainwater in farm ponds and Jalkunds was used for live-saving irrigation in the winter months and diversified homestead farming activities, such as growing high-value crops and rearing cattle, pigs, and poultry.</h4>
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <h4>Maize, french bean, potato, ginger, tomato, carrot, and chili yields in the IOFS model increased by 20%−30%, 40%−45%, 25%−30%, 33%−40%, 45%−50%, 37%−50%, and 27%−30%, respectively, compared with traditional practices. Some farmers produced vermicompost in vermibeds (made of high-density polyethylene) and cement brick chambers, generating 0.4−1.25 tons per annum. Two individual farmers, Mr. Jrill Makroh and Mrs. Skola Kurbah obtained net returns (without premium price) of Rs. 46,695 ± 418 and Rs. 31,102 ± 501 from their respective 0.27- and 0.21-ha IOFS models, which is equivalent to Rs. 172,944 ± 1,548/ha/year and Rs. 148,105 ± 2,385/ha/year, respectively. The net returns obtained from the IOFS models were significantly higher than those obtained from the farmers' practice of maize-fallow or cultivation of maize followed by vegetable (~30% of the areas). It is expected that, with the certification of organic products, the income and livelihood of the farmers will improve further over the years. While Mr. Jrill Makroh's model supplied 95.1%, 82.0%, and 96.0% of the total N, P2O5, and K2O, respectively, needed by the system, Mrs. Skola Kurbah's model supplied 76.0%, 68.6%, and 85.5% of the total N, P2O5, and K2O, respectively.</h4>

            <h2>Animal components</h2>
            <h4>in addition to the improved technology of the housing system, the improved pig variety “Lumsniang” (with 25% genetic inheritance of Khasi local and 75% genetic inheritance of Hampshire) was also introduced to the village. These pigs attained a higher body weight at an early age, as well as a larger litter size at weaning, than the local non-descriptive pigs in the low input tribal production system. The deep litter housing system provides a better micro-environment during both summer and winter, with better physiological adaptation. Approximately 1,000–1,500 kg of well-decomposed manure/year was produced by replacing the bedding material in the pigsty. In Meghalaya, backyard poultry farming has emerged as an important alternative livelihood option for farm women, providing income and household nutritional security. Most of the backyard poultry production involves the rearing of indigenous birds with poor production performance. Dual-purpose backyard poultry birds (the Vanaraja and Gramapriya varieties) with high production potential were introduced into the IOFS models developed in the village. Feed for the poultry and pigs was the major constraint. Emphasis was placed on the production of maize grain for feed purposes and the cultivation of fodder (hybrid bajra napier, congo-signal, broom grass, etc.) and the multipurpose tree Colocasia for cattle and pigs.</h4>
<h2>Organic management of insect pests and diseases</h2>
<h4>Pest management for various crops in an IOFS involved proper sanitation, clean cultivation, and the manual collection and destruction of egg masses and larvae of lepidopteron pests at the initial stage of incidence. Therefore, insect pest infestation was avoided in very severe conditions on most of the crops. However, the infestation of fruit borers in tomatoes, cabbage butterflies and aphids in cole crops, lepidopteron borers in maize, and aphids in beans was as a major problem. For keeping the pest population below the economic damage level, neem oil 0.03% (5 ml/L) and Bacillus thuringinesis (2 g/L) were sprayed alternatively at 10-day intervals to manage lepidopteron pests in cabbage, tomato, maize, and other crops, whereas neem oil and Lecanicillium lecanii (5 g/L) were sprayed to manage aphids and other sucking pests. In addition, a mixture of vermiwash (1 L) and 10–15-day-old cow urine (1 L) in 10 L of water was used as a biopesticide and liquid manure spray on vegetable crops. Diseases were managed within the system using Trichoderma- and P. fluorescence-based formulations. Seed/rhizome treatment was carried out in many cases, e.g., for ginger and French bean. For ginger, rhizome treatment was performed by preparing a suspension of Trichoderma formulation (3 g/L), and 10 L of this suspension was used for treating 10 kg of seed rhizomes. Rhizomes were kept in the suspension for 45 min and then shade-dried for 24 h before sowing. During July and August, the incidence and severity of Pythium soft rot and bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum is high; therefore, the affected spots and nearby healthy clumps were soil drenched with Trichoderma and P. fluorescence-based formulations (4 g/L).</h4>
<h2>Residue recycling and nutrient balance in an IOFS</h2>
<h4>Year-round feed, fodder, labor, manure, and water are needed for a successful and sustainable IFS/IOFS model in any particular region (Das et al., 2021). Crop residue management, such as soil surface retention, has a positive impact on soil health (Mishra and Nayak, 2004; Turmel et al., 2015; Ansari et al., 2022a). The regular addition of residue as organic input maintains the soil organic matter (SOM) level for better soil health (FAO, 2011). The quantity and quality of crop residues generated within a farm and their efficient utilization influence soil fertility build-up over time and its subsequent release of nutrients to the crops that follow (Jarvis et al., 1996; Panwar et al., 2021a; Ansari et al., 2022c). The main strengths of an IOFS lie in better resource recycling as an organic farm mainly relies on internal resources and restricts or limits the input of external materials (Nemecek et al., 2011; Panwar et al., 2020). In an organic farming system, the application of crop residue based-vermicompost to the soil is biologically better than the direct application of manure or crop residue (Aynehband et al., 2017; Mukherjee et al., 2023).</h4>
