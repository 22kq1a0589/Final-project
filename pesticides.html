    <h1>PESTICIDES</h1>
    <h2>Definition of Pesticides</h2>
    <h4>The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has defined pesticide as:

        any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying or controlling any pest, including vectors of human or animal disease, unwanted species of plants or animals, causing harm during or otherwise interfering with the production, processing, storage, transport, or marketing of food, agricultural commodities, wood and wood products or animal feedstuffs, or substances that may be administered to animals for the control of insects, arachnids, or other pests in or on their bodies.</h4>
        <h2>Types of Pesticides</h2>
        <h4>Grouped by Types of Pests They Kill
            Insecticides – insects
            Herbicides – plants
            Rodenticides – rodents (rats & mice)
            Bactericides – bacteria
            Fungicides – fungi
            Larvicides – larvae
            Based on how biodegradable they are:
            Pesticides can also be considered as:
            
            Biodegradable: The biodegradable kind is those which can be broken down by microbes and other living beings into harmless compounds.
            Persistent: While the persistent ones are those which may take months or years to break down.</h4>
            <h2>Chemically-related pesticides</h2>
            <h4>Organophosphate:<br>
                Most organophosphates are insecticides, they affect the nervous system by disrupting the enzyme that regulates a neurotransmitter.
                
                Carbamate:<br>
                Similar to the organophosphorus pesticides, the carbamate pesticides also affect the nervous system by disrupting an enzyme that regulates the neurotransmitter. However, the enzyme effects are usually reversible.
                
                Organochlorine insecticides:<br>
                They were commonly used earlier, but now many countries have been removed Organochlorine insecticides from their market due to their health and environmental effects and their persistence (e.g., DDT, chlordane, and toxaphene).
                
                Pyrethroid:<br>
                These are a synthetic version of pyrethrin, a naturally occurring pesticide, found in chrysanthemums(Flower). They were developed in such a way as to maximise their stability in the environment.
                
                Sulfonylurea herbicides:<br>
                The sulfonylureas herbicides have been commercialized for weed control such as pyrithiobac-sodium, cyclosulfamuron, bispyribac-sodium, terbacil, sulfometuron-methyl Sulfosulfuron, rimsulfuron, pyrazosulfuron-ethyl, imazosulfuron, nicosulfuron, oxasulfuron, nicosulfuron, flazasulfuron, primisulfuron-methyl, halosulfuron-methyl, flupyrsulfuron-methyl-sodium, ethoxysulfuron, chlorimuron-ethyl, bensulfuron-methyl, azimsulfuron, and amidosulfuron.
                
                Biopesticides:<br>
                The biopesticides are certain types of pesticides derived from such natural materials as animals, plants, bacteria, and certain minerals.</h4>
                <h2>Examples of pesticides</h2>
                <h4>Examples of pesticides are fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides. Examples of specific synthetic chemical pesticides are glyphosate, Acephate, Deet, Propoxur, Metaldehyde, Boric Acid, Diazinon, Dursban, DDT, Malathion, etc.</h4>
                <h2>Benefits of Pesticides</h2>
                <h4>The major advantage of pesticides is that they can save farmers. By protecting crops from insects and other pests. However, below are some other primary benefits of it.

                    Controlling pests and plant disease vectors.
                    Controlling human/livestock disease vectors and nuisance organisms.
                    Controlling organisms that harm other human activities and structures.</h4>
                    <h2>Effects of Pesticides</h2>
                    <h4>The toxic chemicals in these are designed to deliberately released into the environment. Though each pesticide is meant to kill a certain pest, a very large percentage of pesticides reach a destination other than their target. Instead, they enter the air, water, sediments, and even end up in our food.
                        Pesticides have been linked with human health hazards, from short-term impacts such as headaches and nausea to chronic impacts like cancer, reproductive harm.
                        The use of these also decreases the general biodiversity in the soil. If there are no chemicals in the soil there is higher soil quality, and this allows for higher water retention, which is necessary for plants to grow.</h4>
