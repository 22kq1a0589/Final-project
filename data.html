        <h4>Elaeagnus latifolia L. is a wild fruit widely available in the northeastern states of India, is commonly referred to as the "bastard oleaster". The fruit is known by its different local names (Musleri/Heiyai) in different states in the country. This fruit attains a reddish-orange hue when ripened and exhibits an oblong shape. The fruit is predominantly available from March to April every year. Despite its abundant growth in the wild, it is rarely subjected to processing, rendering it unavailable in the off-season necessitating the need for development of processing equipment and technologies. The fruit is often consumed in its fresh form. As the shelf life of the fruit in the raw form is short, processing is required to extend its availability. The fruit is a rich source of valuable fatty acids and claims an impressive potassium content of 610.13 mg/100 g [1]. Many researchers reported the presence of phenolic compounds in the fruits which makes it potential for the development of functional food products [2,3].

            In recent years, there has been a growing interest in exploring the physicochemical and phytonutrient properties, as well as the nutritional quality of wild edible fruits across different regions [4,5]. The minerals present in the fruit largely depend on the soil condition in which the fruit is grown. There are essential metals that help the human body and there are toxic metals that cannot be consumed in excess. In a study by Pawlos, Chandravanshi, Yohannes, and Embiale [6], wild fruits (Rubus steudneri Schweinf) were analysed for their metallic content (K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd, and Pb), where the toxic metals like Pb and Cd were found. However, in a study by Pawlos, Chandravanshi, Yohannes, and Embiale [7], Embelia schimperi Vatke fruit was totally safe for consumption considering that the toxic minerals were not detected during analysis. Hence, there is need for mineral analysis to identify the toxic metals if present in the currently studied fruit (E. latifolia).
            
            The commercial cultivation of this fruit is limited and faces a significant challenge due to the absence of specialized processing machinery tailored to its specific characteristics. The underutilization of indigenous and minor horticultural crops in the region represents a missed opportunity, as these crops hold the potential to address poverty and enhance food and nutritional security through strategic processing, value addition, and diversified utilization [8]. Leveraging these resources effectively is imperative for sustainable development and improved well-being. Cold storage is a widely used method for preserving fruits and extending their shelf life (A. [9]), however, concerns about its cost-effectiveness are valid and important to consider since the fruit is grown in north eastern India and faces challenges related to limited connectivity, including transportation and communication infrastructure ([10]; P. [11,12]). Due to this, the valuable fruit resource remains underutilized, necessitating the development of appropriate processing techniques.
            
            The physical attributes of the fruit, such as its length, width, and thickness, play a pivotal role in determining its structural characteristics and helpful in designing post-harvest machinery and equipment. Additional parameters, including the arithmetic mean diameter, geometric mean diameter, and surface area, are collectively employed to model its structure. These parameters, in turn, serve as valuable tools for predicting the mass that conforms to the established model [13]. Mass constitutes a crucial parameter utilized in fruit grading, with mass graders known for their superior accuracy. This distinction assumes paramount importance in the design of equipment for grading, drying, and cooling systems [14]. Numerous studies have underscored the economic advantages of employing mass grading methods [15]. Similar studies were performed for mass modelling of sohiong [16], blood fruit [17], and persimmon [18].
            
            Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a multi-layer interconnected neural net, is effective and accurate during the prediction of complex parameters where the conventional mathematical model fails to deliver [19]. ANN is applied due to their robustness in handling non-linear relationships and complex datasets, which is ideal for predicting the mass of bastard oleaster fruits based on its physical characteristics. This method enhances the precision of our predictions beyond traditional regression models. ANN can in turn be used instead of mathematical models in machine designing of graders, dryers, and coolers. The development of ANN is as inspired from the biological neural system of human brain. A set of experimental data is required to train the ANN models and which is later validated by using various sets of input variables. The adaptations made by ANN from various trial and errors are used during the prediction of process parameters in food processing equipment [[20], [21], [22]].
            
            This study introduces a novel approach by employing ANN model for precise mass prediction of bastard oleaster fruits, a technique not previously applied to this underexplored fruit. This innovative method, combined with an exhaustive analysis of the fruit's physicochemical and nutritional attributes, addresses critical gaps in the current scientific literature and offers novel insights into its potential agricultural and nutritional applications. The main goal of the research study was to thoroughly analyse the physical, thermal, and chemical properties of E. latifolia in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of its inherent characteristics. Additionally, the objective was to develop and rigorously validate a regression model that incorporates parameters such as length, width, thickness, arithmetic mean diameter, geometric mean diameter, and surface area to accurately predict E. latifolia mass and facilitate the design of a highly precise grading machine. Moreover, the study included the quantification of anti-nutritional compounds and the assessment and quantification of phenolic and flavonoid content in the fruit, as well as the identification of various metabolites.

                <h4>Bioactive compounds in brown seaweed and their preventive and therapeutic effects. Three brown seaweeds, Undaria pinnatifida, Saccharina japonica, and Saccharina latissima (Sugar kelp), contain various bioactive compounds, including dipeptide, phlorotannin, alginate, fucoidan, laminarin, fucoxanthin, and fucosterol. The bioactive compounds have therapeutic potential for anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, anti-diabetic, and anti-fibrogenic benefits.

                    Seaweeds are classified into three main phyla: brown seaweed (Ochrophyta), red seaweed (Rhodophyta), and green seaweed (Chlorophyta) [10]. Red and green seaweeds are rich in carbohydrates, while brown seaweed has a high iodine content and soluble fiber, such as alginate, fucoidan, and laminarin [11]. Brown seaweed is mainly consumed in East Asia, particularly in South Korea, Japan, and China [12]. It is composed of ∼1500–2000 species, categorized into more than 250 genera [13], and Undaria pinnatifida, Saccharina japonica (formerly known as Laminaria japonica), and Saccharina latissima (Sugar kelp) are commonly consumed [[14], [15], [16]]. Undaria pinnatifida, known as Miyeok in Korea and Wakame in Japan, is a brown seaweed widely consumed in Korea and Japan, and it grows abundantly along the Korean and Japanese shores and parts of Australia and New Zealand [17]. Undaria pinnatifida is abundant in polyphenols, polysaccharides, peptides, phytosterols, and flavonoids, which exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic properties [[18], [19], [20]]. Saccharina japonica, also known as Dasima in Korea and prevalent along the temperate coasts of northwest Asia, is known for its immunoregulatory, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic effects due to its high polysaccharide content [[21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]]. Sugar kelp, cultivated in the North Atlantic and Alaska [31], is rich in polyphenols and fucoxanthin, which has antioxidant properties [32,33]. Furthermore, sugar kelp consumption mitigates obesity and metabolic dysfunctions in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice [[34], [35], [36], [37], [38]].
                    
                    As the demand for seaweed-based products continues to grow in the United States [39], further investigation is needed to understand the health benefits of bioactive compounds in brown seaweed. Additionally, it is imperative to address health concerns, including potential heavy metal contamination and iodine toxicity. This review spotlights the health benefits and concerns of three major brown seaweeds, i.e., Undaria pinnatifida, Saccharina japonica, Sugar kelp, and other minor ones.
                    
                    2. Bioactive compounds in brown seaweed and their potential preventive and therapeutic effects
                    This section overviews various biological functions of several types of brown seaweed, including three main brown seaweeds, and their bioactive compounds.
                    
                    2.1. Proteins/peptides
                    The total protein content in seaweed typically ranges from 5 % to 47 % of dry mass [5]. When treating hypertension, it is critical to inhibit an angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE I), which converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II, and angiotensin-II serves as a vasoconstrictor that triggers the release of aldosterone from adrenal glands [40]. Therefore, inhibition of ACE I decreases aldosterone secretion, reducing sodium reabsorption and water retention to maintain blood pressure [41]. A study has shown that peptides from Undaria pinnatifida have an anti-hypertensive property [42]. In this study, 10 different dipeptides with an ACE-inhibitory activity were isolated from the water extract of Undaria pinnatifida. Among the 10 dipeptides, Tyr-His, Lys-Tyr, Phe-Tyr, and Ile-Ty, which displayed high ACE inhibitory activity, were orally administered to hypertensive rats. The orally administered dipeptides significantly reduced blood pressure in hypertensive rats compared to their control, indicating they exert an anti-hypertensive effect by inhibiting ACE I. Mousaie & Khodadadi [43] reported that hydrolysate proteins from Sargassum ilicifolium, a brown seaweed, showed an antioxidant ability, assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothizoline-6-sulfonic acid), and Ferric ion reducing antioxidant power assays, similar to a well-known antioxidant, tertiary butylhydroquinone.

                        <h4>Over the last two decades, the intensification of cropping, expansion of irrigation and adoption of modern crop varieties has been supported by increased use of fertilizer globally [1]. Increased use of fertilizer improved agriculture productivity of small-scale farms, especially where farmers’ fertilizer rates had previously been suboptimal. However, unbalanced (overuse or underuse relative to crop requirements) fertilizer use is still prevalent, resulting in crop yield gaps, depletion of some soil nutrient reserves, and detrimental off-site impacts [2,3]. As a result, gaps between actual and potential yields of major crops are still prominent worldwide [4,5]. Closing yield gaps of rice, maize and wheat crops by proper agronomic management practices could increase their global production by 47 %, 65 % and 71 %, respectively that could feed millions of poor people living below the poverty line [6].

                            The densely populated Eastern Gangetic Plain (EGP), home of over 450 million people, is one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change impacts causing potential threats to livelihood outcomes and well-being [7,8]. Low crop yield of the farms in the EGP is directly associated with food insecurity. For example, a baseline survey by Ref. [9] reported that benefit-cost ratios (BCR) of monsoon rice cultivated in the south-west coastal regions (SCR) and north-west (intensive cropping areas) regions of Bangladesh (NWR) (1.17 and 1.28, respectively) are low because of low crop yield as consequence of unbalanced nutrient use practices by the small-scale farms. Moreover, BCR of pre-monsoon rice cultivation is less than one (0.99) in SCR indicating that farmers are not in a profitable position that could hamper sustainable intensification in the saline coastal region. The governments of the EGP especially Bangladesh are desperately seeking suitable road maps to encourage single-crop farmers to convert to double cropping [10].
                            
                            Recently, a study reported that using balanced fertilizers (i.e. according to government-recommended rates) could increase rice yield by 7–22 % over farmers’ practice in saline-affected areas of SCR [11]. For example, suboptimal use of P relative to Government-endorsed recommendation can depress crop yield by 5–15 % [12]. On the other hand, overuse of N and P causes low nutrient use efficiency, increased greenhouse gas emissions and groundwater contamination [[13], [14], [15]]. Increasing N efficiency by only 1 % through balanced fertilizer use practices could save approximately 0.4 million tonnes of urea in India [16]. Despite that [17] found that farmers including small-scale farms of SCR used on an average 12 % and 70 % higher doses of N and P, respectively, relative to Government-endorsed recommendations in the cropping season under fully rice-based cropping systems (FRCP). The level of overuse of N and P was even higher (106 % & 49 %, respectively) for the pattern with high-value watermelon crop. On the other hand, K, S and micronutrient (Zn & B) use rates by small-scale farmers of SCR were at suboptimal levels under FRCP, which also could be detrimental to crop yields and farming profitability [17]. Similarly [18], reported that large-scale and medium-scale farmers in the NWR used almost 11–16 %, 80–90 % and 21–30 % over-doses of NPK under rice-based cropping systems, respectively.
                            
                            Although some countries in the EGP provide subsidies to increase fertilizer use, often this kind of policy resulted in uneven benefits among different farm sizes, crops and regions without achieving balanced fertilizer use [19]. In some cases, the fertilizer subsidy policies serve a government political agenda rather advancing food security, per se [20]. As a result, excess use of subsidized fertilizers relative to government-endorsed recommendations adds to the direct cost for the governments without a commensurate return in the form of greater food security [17]. Recent studies revealed that farmers intended to use excess nutrients in profit-potential crops which often resulted in suboptimal use of recommended nutrients in the subsequent crops in the same cropping systems [17,21]. Farmers deduced that residual nutrients of high-value crops can provide sufficient nutrients to the subsequent crops which in turn maximizes crop profitability by reducing production cost [17,18]. This suggest that farmers’ current nutrient use gaps largely depend on cropping systems. However, a limitation of previous studies is that they focused on single crops whereas farmers in intensive cropping systems grow a diverse range of crops in addition to the monsoon season rice crop [9,22,23]. That’s why it is essential to determine the factors which are responsible for farmers’ current nutrient use gaps (overuse or underuse) especially under diverse rice-based cropping systems.
                            
                            The present study was conducted in four Agro-ecological Zones (AEZ) of the EGP in Bangladesh which covered both SCR and NWR, where rice yield gaps of small-scale farmers are large relative to potential rice yield [24]. </h4>

                                <h4>Among plant pathogens jeopardizing the health of plants and crop productions, oomycetes belonging to the genus Phytophthora stand out for their aggressiveness and wide host range [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]]. In this respect, species such as Phytophthora infestans and P. ramorum were responsible of historical epidemics, while other species belonging to the genus Phytophthora, such as Phytophthora × cambivora, P. cinnamomi, P. citricola, P. citrophthora, P. multivora, P. nicotianae, P. palmivora, are among the most polyphagous and well known as causative agents of relevant diseases in both agro- and forest-ecosystems. For example, P. nicotianae, together with P. citrophthora and P. palmivora and, to a lesser extent, P. citricola, are well known to be the major Phytophthora species associated to citrus diseases, such as foot and crown rot, fibrous root rot and brown rot of fruit [5,[11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]]. Phytophthora × cambivora, P. cinnamomi and P. multivora are widespread in temperate forests, where they cause severe syndromes on both productive plant species, such as chestnut and oaks, and plant species of ecological significance [[18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]]. Other Phytophthora species with a more limited host-range include P. infestans and P. ramorum. The former is infamous as causal agent of 'Irish famine' in the 1840's [1,24], while the latter is, a quarantine plant pathogen which has gone out history for causing the ‘sudden oak death’, a devasting disease affecting several native oak species in California and characterized by bleeding trunk cankers and tree dieback [20,[25], [26], [27], [28], [29]]. Other Phytophthora species with a very restricted range of known natural hosts are P. oleae, causative agent of rots of olive drupes [30,31], and P. parvispora, a species that originally was recovered in natural ecosystems [20,32,33], and whose host-range comprises citrus plants and fruits [34,35]. Traditionally, the effective management of Phytophthora diseases has been achieved by the employment of specific chemicals, such as the methyl N-(methoxyacetyl)-N-(2,6-xylyl)-dl-alaninate, commonly known as metalaxyl, and the fosetyl-Al [5,13,[35], [36], [37], [38]]. However, as a consequence of restrictive policies limiting the use of pesticides, the majority of current strategies of plant disease control are oriented toward the adoption of means environmentally safe and secure for human health [39]. For this reason, the scientific community is focused in identifying new eco-friendly means as an effective alternative to conventional chemicals [20,[39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44]]. They encompass antagonistic microorganisms or their derivatives [42,43,[45], [46], [47], [48]], natural substances such as botanicals and other generally regarded as safe (GRAS) antimicrobial substances [[49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54]]. Recently, there is mounting interest in new categories of natural pesticides. Byproducts of food waste, such as extracts from parts of edible plants (fruit peel, seed coat, seed shell, and leaf) and shellfish, are emerging as a source of bioactive compounds with pesticidal activity toward plant pathogens [55,55,56]. Ongoing investigations into extracts derived from food waste are shedding light on the possibility of increasing their efficacy through fermentation processes involving lactobacilli [41,43,46,50]. Lactobacilli fermentates have displayed remarkable effectiveness in thwarting post-harvest fungal rots in various agricultural crops [41,53,57,58]. Moreover, a recent study has highlighted the notable in vivo and in vitro antifungal activity of two extracts of lemon fruit peel-medium fermented with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strains N3B2 and M2B2, respectively [43]. The marked effectiveness of these fermentates was directly correlated to the production of certain antifungal bacterial metabolites, such as lactic acid, acetic acid and DL-3-phenyllactic acid [48,52,58]. Among the array of compounds in the liquid and volatile fractions of these fermentates, organic acids stood out for their high abundance, especially in the fermentate produced with the strain N3B2 [43]. Findings of Riolo et al. [43] highlight the potential of exploiting waste materials for sustainable applications in agriculture and also highlighted the promising role of microbial fermentation in enhancing the bioactivity of such resources. However, the effectiveness of this type of fermentates in controlling Phytophthora species and diseases they cause has been little investigated. In order to fill this gap the present study investigated the anti-oomycete activity of a bioactive formulation obtained through the fermentation of lemon peel powder with a selected strain of L. plantarum and its effectiveness in controlling Phytophthora rot of orange and apple fruits.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Lemon medium (LM) -based formulation
A bioactive formulation based on lemon peel medium (bioact-LM) was prepared in accordance with Riolo et al. [43]. The bioactive LM-based formulation was prepared in accordance with Riolo et al. [43] by using a commercial lemon peel powder (Dr. Wakde's®, London, UK) and the Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strain N3B2 [43]. Specifically, 50.0 g of lemon peel powder were homogenized in 400.0 mL of sterile distilled water (SDW) by stirring for 5 min at 150 rpm. The resulting mixture was filtered through 2 qualitative grade paper filter papers (size retention of 8.0 μm) (Whatman® Filter Paper, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), amended with an aqueous nutrient solution (MM) (0.49 % glucose, 0.49 % yeast extract, 0.49 % tryptone, 0.12 % (NH₄)₂SO₄, 0.31 % NaCl, 0.12 % KH₂PO₄, 0.01 % MgSO₄, and 0.003 % MnSO₄) at a ratio 1 LM: 5 MM, and autoclaved at 121 °C for 21 min. After cooling, the autoclaved LM formula was inoculated with a suspension of the bacterium Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, strain N3B2, which was previously grown in Man Rogosa and Sharpe broth for 24 h at 37 °C, at a ratio 1:100 (v/v). The obtained bacterial suspension in LM formula was incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and an orbital agitation at 120 rpm. After incubation, the bioactive bacterial suspension of LM was reduced to a powder using a spray-drying equipment (OLT-SD8000B, XIAMEN Ollital Technology, China) with a liquid flow rate of 12 mL/min. The obtained bioactive LM-based formulation, reduced at a powder, was stored at room temperature until further use.</h4>

    <h4>Consumers' beliefs and perceptions about products are major factors contributing to the acceptance or rejection of products. In many markets, erroneous perceptions and beliefs about a product can lead to its rejection or lower use and vice-versa. For example, cultured meat is considered an alternative protein with many advantages over meat from animals. Yet many consumers are resistant to eating cultured meat. In their article, Rosenfeld and Tomiyama [1] reviewed reasons for consumer resistance and suggested that proper communication about the production and benefits of cultured meat can improve the acceptance of this new product. Udomkun et al. [2] found that nutrition, harmful effects, odor, and availability of meat products in the markets were among the key factors influencing consumers' preference and willingness to pay for meat products in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In a recent publication, Hoel et al. [3] demonstrated that misperceptions about the quality of fertilizer in many African countries could prevent learning, and it has contributed to the low use of inorganic fertilizer, contributing to low agricultural productivity in the continent that also includes DRC, Mali, and Niger. Beyond the above examples, the literature review focuses on consumer acceptance of products, especially meat products whose demand has recorded an upward trend following the current demographic pressure, making it necessary to provide a comprehensive analysis of consumers’ perceptions of new products [4]. Globally, meat supply is expected to reach 374 Mt by 2030 [5], with Africa at the forefront, as continental consumption is predicted to be 30 % higher compared to other world regions [6]. In the Republic of Congo, the fresh meat market is projected to grow by 5.32 % (2024–2028), resulting in a market volume of €380.40 m in 2028 [7]. The meat market in the DRC has also experienced steady growth. The information available shows that the overall growth in the volume of imports (beef, pork, and edible offal) was strong at +128 % and +178 % in value terms between 2010 and 2014 [8]. In Mali and Niger, Desiere et al. [9] found income elasticities estimated based on food expenditure from Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) surveys at 0.60 and 1.71 and the expected growth in per capita meat and fish consumption at 32 % and 101 %, respectively, if income (Gross Domestic Product (GDP)) doubles.

Despite the upward trend in meat supply, the meat diet poses several environmental and biodiversity issues [[6], [7], [8], [9], [10]]. Its contribution to agriculture's total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is approximately 54 % globally [5], and, as reported by González et al. [11], its contribution to the global GHG emissions ranges between 12 % and 18 %. It is, however, important to note that meat-based diets environmental footprint varies from one type of meat to the other [[11], [12], [13]]. For instance, ruminant production produces more emissions than nonruminant mammals, such as pig, and fish and poultry production [14]. Furthermore, from the economic perspective, the latter categories are cost-efficient. Therefore, the production of nonruminant mammals such as pigs, and poultry and fish is expected to increase in the coming years [5].

Moving forward addressing the environmental challenge of meat supply would require sustainable livestock inputs. Conventional animal feed protein ingredients, such as soybean, fishmeal, and grains, are expensive and unsustainable in reducing the environmental footprint of meat production due to their relatively higher input demand, such as land, water, fertilizer, etc., making them not cost-effective [15,16]. In contrast, interest in insects is growing as a novel, cost-efficient, and eco-friendly alternative protein source in animal feed and, in some contexts, as human food [[17], [18], [19], [20]]. Another good reason why insects become interesting is to reduce the use of agricultural products as feed that should be used as human food products, thus reducing feed-food competition [11,12,15]. However, most consumers have negative attitudes towards eating insects on their own [6]. Therefore, the data suggests that indirect routes of consumption (e.g., consuming animals that have eaten insects) are more acceptable than direct consumption.</h4>
