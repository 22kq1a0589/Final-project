        <h1>IMPORTANCE OF ANIMALS IN AGRICULTURE</h1>
        <h3>Importantly, although often overlooked, meat, milk, eggs, and other animal products, including fish and other seafoods, will play an important role in achieving food security for several reasons.

            First, animal products are an important source of high-quality, balanced, and highly bioavailable protein and numerous critical micronutrients, including iron, zinc, and vitamins B-12 and A, many of which are deficient in a large portion of the world's population (10–12). Thus, moderate consumption of animal-sourced foods plays an important role in achieving a nutritionally balanced diet, especially in the developing world (11–13).
            
            Second, because they are recognized as high-quality foods, global demand for animal products is almost certain to continue to increase dramatically (10, 13–16). The drivers of the increased demand for animal products include not only population growth but also increased affluence, especially in the developing world, where most of the increase in population will occur (3).
            
            Third, farm animals are critical to a sustainable agricultural system and especially for smallholders who comprise most of the world's farmers (12–16). Farm animals contribute not only a source of high-quality food that improves nutritional status but also additional resources such as manure for fertilizer, on-farm power, and other by-products, and, in addition, provide economic diversification and risk distribution (12, 13, 16–18). Moreover, increased efficiencies in the past several decades through genetic selection and improved management technologies has saved a large amount of resources, including water and land, and have substantially reduced the carbon footprint of animal production (16, 18, 19).
            
            Fourth, ruminants such as buffalo, cattle, goats, and sheep, efficiently convert the forages from grasslands into high-quality animal products, and grazing also can promote the health and biodiversity of grasslands if managed appropriately (16, 19–23). This is important because grassland pastures cover >25% of the Earth's land surface and, despite being home to nearly a billion people, comprise primarily marginally or non-arable land (24, 25).
            
            However, sustainable farm animal production will also require a more complete understanding of their impact on the environment. For example, a report by the FAO of the UN estimated that livestock, and especially ruminants, contribute as much as 18% of greenhouse gas emissions (26), but others have suggested that this is a gross overestimate and that the actual value may be as low as 3% (27). Regardless, as farm animal production continues to increase, we need to be concerned with not only greenhouse gases but also the impact of farm animals on soil, water, and biodiversity (26, 28). We also need to better understand the specific role of animal products in the diet in the global increase in noncommunicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, because noncommunicable diseases are now responsible for more deaths worldwide than all other causes (29, 30). In this regard, recent reports from the National Research Council and from the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Department of Health and Human Services, argue strongly for renewed focus, including additional research, on these controversial and critical issues (15, 31).
            
            Go to:
            Conclusion
            Solving the problems and overcoming the obstacles to sustainable food security, although daunting, are not options, because food security is critical not only to national security but also to global stability (32). Feeding the world's rapidly expanding population can therefore rightly be viewed as the main global challenge of the 21st century. Animals will play an important role in meeting this challenge.</h3>
            <h3>Farm animals provide renewable energy for agriculture in developing countries. The use of draught  animal  power  in land preparation, weeding and harvesting improves  the  soil  structure  and thereby conserves the soil. Farm animals play a key role in  the integration of nutrients  into the soil. Ruminants, who graze on the  pasture, and  are  fed with  crop  residues  and by-products yield manure  to  the  soil. Poultry manure is also rich in many nutrients which can be used to fertilize the crops. Livestock can be  used to control  the  weeds  in agricultural  lands  especially in plantation crops. They  are  currently being  used in plantations of coconut, rubber, mango, and sugarcane. While  grazing  most  commonly; cattle, goat and sheep add manure as organic fertilizer to grazing lands.   Ecosystem services of livestock species and the consequences of different management practices of livestock farming  are yet  to be well understood. As the livestock population is increasing, it contributes to contamination of groundwater, eutrophication and soil pollution. In  addition,  livestock  farming  produces significant  quantities  of  “greenhouse  gases”, thereby  contributing  to  global  warming. Interactions between livestock management</h3>
            <h3>Similar to crop production, the role of farm animals  in food security is important because livestock plays a significant role in the ecosystems. They  are the most positive contributors in many agro-ecosystems transforming feed into  nutritious food and useful  products. Cattle convert  grass  into milk and meat; interact directly with ecosystems  through grazing and the production  of dung and urine. Poultry are also  vital  for human  nutrition because it provides meat and eggs in food security and contributing to mixed farming practices and women empowerment  (Wong et al, 2017). In  order  to fulfill  the  demand for animal products  to feed the human population  in the next few decades, the livestock industry has a massive role  to play.   However, with the increasing demand for food and  other basic needs  of humans, the  ecosystems are highly threatened and imbalanced. Quick attention and practical measures are highly required to safeguard the ecosystems. Livestock species have  been domesticated, selected and bred over the years, creating a range  of breeds  with  specific  traits. These breeds  are  adapted  to  specific environments, for the  conversion  of particular types  of vegetation into  food, or for the production of specific products. High producers  are  intensively bred  to  supply uniform  products  under  an  intensive management  system.  Small-scale  farmers mainly keep multipurpose  breeds  in low input production systems. Most of the farm animals  actively contribute  to integrated sustainable farming systems. Milk, meat, eggs, dairy products and edible offal supply essential protein, vitamins and other micronutrients. Milk in  the diet can tremendously be important for eliminating malnutrition  and ensuring healthy development in children. Certainly, animal products  are  the  best sources  of quality protein with high bioavailability. Further, they  are  rich  in  many  deficient micronutrients  such  as  iron, zinc, and 
                3  Sri Lankan Journal of Agriculture and Ecosystems, 3(1): 1-4, 2021   vitamins  B-12 and A (McAfee, 2010; Randolph, 2007). Since farm  animals are recognized  as  quality  foods, demand for animal  products  continues  to  increase. Specially, chicken meat  and eggs  are  the best sources of protein that can be afforded by  the  majority of people. In  developing countries, the diet of people living in cities usually contains more animal protein than that of rural  people mainly because they generally have access to a wider variety of foods  at local  markets. In  low-income countries, chicken meat  is well placed  to satisfy  the  demands of  the  middle  class who can afford to pay for meat of broiler chickens (Muchenje et al. 2018).  Small  scale  farmers  contribute  to  food production  and play  a  significant  role  in minimizing food insecurity, especially among poor rural household. Farm animals are  a  component of their farming systems and contribute  not only  to  the  direct  food production  but  also  include  multiple  uses such as fertilizer, fuel, capital  accumulation and  other  by-products. Furthermore, farm animals  are  closely associated with the social  and cultural  lives  of  many  people. Farm animals  provide  economic diversification  and risk  distribution which reduce  income  variability.  In  marginal environments  where  crop  production  is limited, well-adapted breeds can be  reared which enhances the land-use efficiency.   Farm animals provide renewable energy for agriculture in developing countries. The use of draught  animal  power  in land preparation, weeding and harvesting improves  the  soil  structure  and thereby conserves the soil. Farm animals play a key role in  the integration of nutrients  into the soil. Ruminants, who graze on the  pasture, and  are  fed with  crop  residues  and by-products yield manure  to  the  soil.

Therefore,  suitable mechanisms  are  vital  to  be  introduced  to conserve  and  maintain  the  ecosystem  in  a sustainable manner.

                <h2>Role of Animal Husbandry in Human Welfare</h2>
                <h4>Dairy Products
                    Animals such as cows, goats, sheep, etc. are the major source of milk and milk products such as yoghurt, cheese, butter, etc.
                    
                    Meat
                    Animals such as cows, buffaloes, pigs, and goats are reared for their meat. Their meat is a rich source of dietary protein.
                    
                    Land Management
                    The livestock is sometimes grazed to control the growth of weeds on agricultural land. The dry shrubs in the areas that are prone to wildfire are eaten by goat and sheep, which reduces the risk of fire.
                    
                    Fibre
                    Animals also produce fibres or textiles such as wool and leather. For eg, sheep are reared for wool whereas leather can be obtained from camel.
                    
                    Manure
                    The excreta, blood and bones of animals are used as manure. The manure is spread on the fields to increase the crop yields and crop production. It is also used as fuel for fires and as plaster for walls and floor.
                    
                    Labour
                    Animals are a source of non-human labour. They are used for ploughing fields, transporting goods and military functions. For ag., horses, yaks and donkeys are used for such purposes.</h4>
                    <h2>Advantages of Animal Husbandry</h2>
                    <h4>1.Animal husbandry helps in the proper management of animals by providing proper food, shelter and protection against diseases to domestic animals.
                        2.It provides employment to a large number of farmer and thereby increases their living standards.
                        3.It helps in developing high yielding breeds of animals by cross breeding. This increases the production of various food products such as milk, eggs, meat, etc.
                        4.It involves the proper disposal of animal waste and promotes a healthy environment.
