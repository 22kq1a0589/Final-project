        <div class="text"><p>A fertilizer (American English) or fertiliser (British English) is any material of natural or synthetic origin that is applied to soil or to plant tissues to supply plant nutrients. Fertilizers may be distinct from liming materials or other non-nutrient soil amendments. Many sources of fertilizer exist, both natural and industrially produced.[1] For most modern agricultural practices, fertilization focuses on three main macro nutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) with occasional addition of supplements like rock flour for micronutrients. Farmers apply these fertilizers in a variety of ways: through dry or pelletized or liquid application processes, using large agricultural equipment or hand-tool methods.Historically fertilization came from natural or organic sources: compost, animal manure, human manure, harvested minerals, crop rotations and byproducts of human-nature industries (i.e. fish processing waste, or bloodmeal from animal slaughter). However, starting in the 19th century, after innovations in plant nutrition, an agricultural industry developed around synthetically created fertilizers. This transition was important in transforming the global food system, allowing for larger-scale industrial agriculture with large crop yields.</p></div>

    <div class="text">Nitrogen fixation is a chemical process by which molecular nitrogen (N
        2), which has a strong triple covalent bond, is converted into ammonia (NH
        3) or related nitrogenous compounds, typically in soil or aquatic systems[1] but also in industry. The nitrogen in air is molecular dinitrogen, a relatively nonreactive molecule that is metabolically useless to all but a few microorganisms. Biological nitrogen fixation or diazotrophy is an important microbe-mediated process that converts dinitrogen (N2) gas to ammonia (NH3) using the nitrogenase protein complex (Nif).[2][3]
        
        Nitrogen fixation is essential to life because fixed inorganic nitrogen compounds are required for the biosynthesis of all nitrogen-containing organic compounds, such as amino acids and proteins, nucleoside triphosphates and nucleic acids. As part of the nitrogen cycle, it is essential for agriculture and the manufacture of fertilizer. It is also, indirectly, relevant to the manufacture of all nitrogen chemical compounds, which include some explosives, pharmaceuticals, and dyes.

        <div class="text"><p>In total, plants need at least 16 elements, of which the most important are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Plants obtain carbon from the atmosphere and hydrogen and oxygen from water; other nutrients are taken up from the soil. Although plants contain sodium, iodine, and cobalt, these are apparently not essential. This is also true of silicon and aluminum.

            Overall chemical analyses indicate that the total supply of nutrients in soils is usually high in comparison with the requirements of crop plants. Much of this potential supply, however, is bound tightly in forms that are not released to crops fast enough to give satisfactory growth.Because of this, the farmer is interested in measuring the available nutrient supply as contrasted to the total nutrient supply. When the available supply of a given nutrient becomes depleted, its absence becomes a limiting factor in plant growth. Excessive quantities of some nutrients may cause a decrease in yield, however.</p></div>

        <div class="text">Most nitrogen fertilizers are obtained from synthetic ammonia; this chemical compound (NH3) is used either as a gas or in a water solution, or it is converted into salts such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium phosphate, but packinghouse wastes, treated garbage, sewage, and manure are also common sources of it. Because its nitrogen content is high and is readily converted to ammonia in the soil, urea is one of the most concentrated nitrogenous fertilizers. An inexpensive compound, it is incorporated in mixed fertilizers as well as being applied alone to the soil or sprayed on foliage. With formaldehyde it gives methylene-urea fertilizers, which release nitrogen slowly, continuously, and uniformly, a full yearâ€™s supply being applied at one time.</div>

        <div class="text">Organic fertilizers increase microbial activity in the soil, causing increased nutrient mineralization rates for the benefit of crops. They stimulate the activities of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria [17] and arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi that form networks of root extension for extensive nutrient availability to crops.Among the major environmental impacts may be contamination of soil, water, and air by nutrients, organic carbon (C), heavy metals, and pathogens, as well as air contamination by particulate matters, noxious gases, and pathogens.Soil physical properties affected by SOM include bulk density, aggregation, water retention and movement, air composition, and heat capacity and transmission. Soil physical processes impacted by SOM content include crusting, compaction, water runoff, erosion, gaseous diffusion, and nutrient transformation and movement.</div>
